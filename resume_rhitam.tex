\sectionStart
 \jobHeading
    {Software Development Engineer}
    {March 2022 - now}
    {Wint Wealth | Backend Team}
  \listStart
    \bulletItem
    {Architected and executed the first-ever \textbf{Two Factor Authentication (2FA)} system for our Web and Mobile Apps, a move that effectively \textbf{eliminated security breaches}. This was a significant upgrade from the previous system where OTPs were managed by third-party vendors. I introduced an innovative approach of using Redis for temporary OTP storage. This led to a \textbf{90\% reduction in login issue tickets} and ensured our \textbf{platformâ€™s compliance with SEBI security standards}. Today, my 2FA APIs are a cornerstone of our security infrastructure, serving \textbf{50,000+ active users per month}.}
\bulletItem
    {Developed the \textbf{SIM Binding protocol} for our platform, enhancing security by verifying SIM ownership. This was crucial for the Unity FD product, launched in December 2023. The protocol has enabled \textbf{200+ users} to securely purchase Unity FDs, generating \textbf{1.5+ lakh rupees in revenue}.}
    \bulletItem
    {Led the Strapi CMS integration into Wint's AWS infrastructure, transforming content management. Previously, updates to texts, colours, and SEO keywords were manually deployed by frontend engineers. I configured AWS's VPC, Route Tables, Internet Gateway, NAT Gateway, EC2, Elastic Beanstalk, CDN, S3, and RDS together to form a comprehensive Wint CMS powered by open source Strapi that enabled instant updates to textual information at both website and apps. Strapi APIs currently garner \textbf{100,000+ monthly reach} and showcased its value when a poorly visible modal in the bond referral version 3 was \textbf{redesigned and launched within an hour}, \textbf{boosting user interaction by 65\%}.}
 \bulletItem
    {Revamped Wint's bond referral program to version 3 in July 2023, enabling automatic distribution of earnings to referrers based on referees' bond interest repayment schedule. Leveraged AWS SNS, SQS, Lambda, Step Functions, and Razorpay X APIs to automate and streamline the repayment process, ensuring timely and accurate rewards. This strategic update attracted \textbf{40,000+ new customers} and generated \textbf{5+ crores of rupees in revenue to date}.}
 \bulletItem
    {Debugged and resolved a persistent issue in the Clevertap tracking platform, where user email IDs were being erroneously mixed. Approximately \textbf{4,000 users received emails about bond repayments they had not purchased}. By implementing a 2-minute delay in the tracking code through strategic use of SQS and Lambda functions, I effectively corrected the error.}
